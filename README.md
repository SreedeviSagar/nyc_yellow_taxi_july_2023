- ### **Problem statement**
- Yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).
- This project understands how the trip duration for yellow taxi is affected by other variables such as 'VendorID', 'tpep_pickup_datetime','tpep_dropoff_datetime','passenger_count', 'trip_distance', 'RatecodeID', 'store_and_fwd_flag','PULocationID', 'DOLocationID', 'payment_type', 'fare_amount', 'extra','mta_tax', 'tip_amount', 'tolls_amount', 'improvement_surcharge',total_amount', 'congestion_surcharge', 'Airport_fee'

- ### **Data Collection**
- Dataset Source - https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
- The data consists of 19 column and 3513649 rows.
